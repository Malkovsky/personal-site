I'm a principal engineer at Chebyshev Research Center at Saint-Petersburg (not to be confused with the SPbSU Chebyshev laboratory, also at Saint-Petersburg) with over 10 years of experience in applied computer science. I specialize in scientific computing where I have a broad theoretical knowledge and project in several fields: ASR systems, application level forward error correction, succinct data structures.

### What I do for living

Throughout my career I worked on real time systems that demand highly optimized software, here's the outline of my projects  

- **ASR Systems** - R&D for HMM-DNN hybrid systems, end-to-end ASR, and transformer-based solutions
- **Network Protocols** - Improving QUIC protocol for file transfer and real-time communication via congestion control algorithms
- **Coding Theory** - Forward error correction codes and their applications to real-time communication data transfer

### Education and career

I graduated from Saint Petersburg State University (2008-2013) and defended my PhD thesis (2017) under the supervision of Professor Oleg Granichin. My research focused on scheduling problems in distributed systems and algorithms for solving some specific tasks.

Since then, I have worked on a variety of projects, from speech recognition systems at STC-innovations and TCS group, to backend development at Yandex.Market, and currently leading advanced R&D projects at Chebyshev Research Center.
